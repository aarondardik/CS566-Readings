# CS566-Readings

The 'main' paper is the one titled "Understanding Over-Squashing and Bottlenecks on Graphs via Curvature" by Jake Topping et al. A few foundational papers were published by Uri Alon and Eran Yahav at the Technion. A few papers by Professor Bogdan were quite helpful as well. The rest of the papers had interesting ideas, but are either more of background material or only partially related.
